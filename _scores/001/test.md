#### Scores

Here is the easiest [version](<Weeknd-Blinding-Lights(easy)-onaccordion.com.pdf>).
It contains just harmonic content of baseline, no rhythm.

Medium [version](<Weeknd-Blinding-Lights(medium)-onaccordion.com.pdf>) has simplified
rhythm in baseline.

Hardest [version](<Weeknd-Blinding-Lights(hard)-onaccordion.com.pdf>) has original
rythm texture.

Enjoy!

Hi, my name is Evita.
I am a professional accordionist, composer and sheet music arranger.
I have performed in [Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia) and abroad both as a soloist and in various chamber ensembles.
I teach private accordion lessons and arrange different styles of music for accordion and piano.

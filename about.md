Hi, my name is Evita.
I am a professional accordionist, composer and sheet music arranger.

I have performed in [Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia) and abroad both as a soloist and in various chamber ensembles.

I teach private accordion lessons and arrange different styles of music for accordion and piano.

Check out FREE downloadable [sheet music]({{ "scores" | relative_url }}) arranged by me.

Suitable for accordion and in most cases valid for piano.

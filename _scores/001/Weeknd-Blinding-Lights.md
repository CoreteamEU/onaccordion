#### Scores

The easiest [version](<Weeknd-Blinding-Lights(easy)-onaccordion.com.pdf>) to play.
It contains just harmonic content of baseline, no rhythm.

More complicated [version](<Weeknd-Blinding-Lights(medium)-onaccordion.com.pdf>) has simplified rhythm in baseline.
The hardest [version](<Weeknd-Blinding-Lights(hard)-onaccordion.com.pdf>) has original rhythm texture.

Enjoy!

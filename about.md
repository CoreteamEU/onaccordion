Hi, my name is Evita.
I am professional accordionist, composer and music sheet arranger.

I have performed in [Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia) and abroad both as a soloist and in various chamber ensembles.

I teach private accordion lessons and arrange music of different styles for accordion.

Suitable for accordion and in most cases valid for piano.
